# Apache<sup>&reg;</sup> DataSketches&trade; Core Go Library Component
This is the core Go component of the DataSketches library.  It contains some of the sketching algorithms and can be accessed directly from user applications.

Note that we have a parallel core component for C++, Java and Python implementations of the same sketch algorithms,
[datasketches-cpp](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-cpp) and [datasketches-java](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-java).

Please visit the main [DataSketches website](https://datasketches.apache.org) for more information.

If you are interested in making contributions to this site please see our [Community](https://datasketches.apache.org/docs/Community/) page for how to contact us.
